## 🚀 What I Do

Building **production ML systems** that serve real users and deliver measurable impact:

- 🤖 RAG architectures with hybrid retrieval (semantic + BM25)
- 📄 Document intelligence (OCR pipelines processing 5k+ PDFs/month)
- 👁️ Computer vision for industrial QC (98% defect detection)
- ⚡ High-performance systems (C++/Rust when Python isn't fast enough)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```python
skills = {
    "ML/AI": ["PyTorch", "Transformers", "Tensorflow", "Keras", "Pytorch", "YOLO", "PaddleOCR"],
    "Engineering": ["Python", "C++", "Rust", "FastAPI", "Docker"],
    "Data": ["Elasticsearch", "PostgreSQL", "Redis", "Vector DBs"],
    "Domains": ["NLP", "Computer Vision", "RAG", "MLOps"]
}
```
